![Mock Up Screen Shot]
(Mock-Screen shot.png)

Above is my wireframe.

The top left is a picture, with the title flowing horizontally. (allows more room for the board)
	--Hoping to place a funny Nic Cage head image, overlapping the title "Memory"

Two buttons at the top floating over another image. One button being a reset and another being a click tracker. 
	--The click tracker is a way to make the game two player. You can try to win the board by beathing your competitor's score. 
	--Reset will turn all the cards back over, and "shuffle" the images in the array so the next game is different.

Next is the game board with 25 "cards" 
	--Click the card to turn over to see the image, and click another card to find it's match. If it is a match the cards will stay turned over, if no match they will automatically turn back over. Continue till all of board is matched.

That's it!
